# OpenCBS
#### Adaptive open-source technology for microfinance.

OpenCBS is a fork of the last open-source version of Octopus Microfinance Suite (which is version 4.7).

The main features are:

- Client management
- Loan management
- Savings management
- Loan schedule generation
- Loan portfolio tracking
- Custom fields for clients, loans, savings
- Report generation

The mid- and long-term vision is to convert the program into a platform through a service-oriented architecture. It means minimizing the core, improving the extensibility framework, and making it frictionless for third-party developers to build upon.
